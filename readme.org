*** Jan Łukasiewicz
He seems to have a logical matrix in his book and also, need to create a catalog of the notations he has employed in his other works such as many valued logics.

** Stamm
Stam seems to be the first person to publish work on Sheffer Stroke and Pierce Arrow: https://twitter.com/rrrichardzach/status/1251532455829319680

** Randolf Diagrams

[[./img/randolf.png]]

Randolf Diagrams were used to notate Boolean operations in a 2 by 2 grid. This can be extended to more than one truth values.

[[./img/randolf-multiple-truth-values.png]]

These might have precursors in X-frame notation of Peirce in “A Proposed Logical Notation (1903)”. Detail from this [[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1108/1108.2429.pdf][paper]]

** Karnaugh Maps
Karnaugh maps are used to notate Boolean algebra. This is an improvement upon Veitch Chart which is a rediscovery of Marquand Diagrams introduced by Allan Marquand.

His take in simplifying Maxwell’s equations could also be helpful in understanding the intellectual framework shift that helped in changing the perspective on functions.
